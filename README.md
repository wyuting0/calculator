# Simple JavaScript Calculator

This project is an extremely simple calculator created for the sole purpose of enabling me to explore JavaScript. The calculator provides a basic interface with buttons for numeric input, arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and functionality for clearing the display and calculating results.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the basic structure of the calculator, including the display and buttons. It links to the stylesheet (`style.css`) for minimal styling and the script file (`script.js`) for essential functionality.

- **style.css**: The stylesheet focuses on providing a clean and straightforward appearance for the calculator.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file contains the logic for appending input to the display, performing calculations, and clearing the display. It is intentionally kept simple to aid in the learning process.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the calculator to practice basic JavaScript:
   - Click numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
   - Click operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to input operators.
   - Click the "=" button to calculate and display the result.
   - Click the "C" button to clear the display.

## Learning Purpose

This project is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, making it an ideal resource for those learning JavaScript. The code is intentionally kept minimal to provide a clear understanding of the essential concepts involved in building a basic interactive web application.
